  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/2 c (100g) refined coconut oil, packed, not melted
    * 2/3 c (140g) brown sugar, packed
    * 3 T maple syrup
    * 1/2 c plant milk
    * 1/3 c (35g) cocoa powder
    * 1 T vanilla
    * 1/2 tsp espresso powder
    * 1 tsp baking powder

    1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
    2. Using a fork, cream together the coconut oil and brown sugar in a large bowl. Then add the vanilla, maple syrup, plant milk, cocoa powder, and instant coffee granules, whisking until combined. Then add the baking powder, baking soda and salt and again whisk until well combined. If the mixture looks clumpy, it’s okay! 
    3. Add the flour to the bowl and stir until just-combined (do not over stir). Then gently fold in the chopped chocolate. 
    4. Form little balls out of the dough and evenly distribute, about 5 cm (2 inches) apart, on a cookie sheet lined with baking paper.
    5. Bake for 12- 15 minutes, or until edges are lightly golden and the tops look set. Cool 1 minute on cooking sheet before transferring to cooling rack to cool completely. Enjoy!

Great soft cookies.  One thing I haven't tried yet, but would like to...
  * substitute oil for 1/2 c applesauce
  * change brown sugar to 1/2 c
