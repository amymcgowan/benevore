A delicious comfort food meal.  There's a fair amount of prep, but if everything is diced ahead of time (or even if the chili and/or cheese is made ahead of time), it goes a lot more quickly.  For another shortcut, I will sometimes just use the frozen french fries from Trader Joes.

Note: This makes _a lot_ of cheese sauce.  I usually half it.
