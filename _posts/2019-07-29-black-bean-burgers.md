    1. Place flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken.
    2. Preheat oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    3. Place beans in a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher or fork until most beans are broken up, leaving some whole beans in tact. 
    4. Add breadcrumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, sriarcha, and flax mixture. Stir until well combined.
    5. Form into 5-6 tightly-packed patties. You can refrigerate them until you are ready to cook (for up to 3 days) or cook them right away.
    6. Bake for about 10-12 minutes per side.
