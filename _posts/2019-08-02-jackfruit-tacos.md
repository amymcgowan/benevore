    1. Place the shredded green jackfruit into a sauce pot, and cover with the BBQ sauce. Stir well, and cook covered on medium-low heat for 10 minutes. The jackfruit and sauce should be gently simmering, but not boiling.
    2. While the jackfruit is cooking prepare your other taco ingredients. Slice the avocado, shred or thinly slice the cabbage, chop the cilantro, slice the lime, and warm the tortillas.
    3. Once the jackfruit is cooked, fill the warm tortillas with all of the ingredients, and drizzle any left over sauce from the pot onto the tacos. Squeeze fresh lime juice over them, and serve.

So simple, so yummy.  Great with American BBQ sauce, but also worth trying with Korean BBQ sauce.
