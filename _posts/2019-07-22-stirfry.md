    **Stir fry**

    * 1 c carrots or bell pepper, diced
    * seasame oil

    * 1 T cornstarch
    * 1 T grated ginger
    * 1 T maple syrup
    * 1/4 c soy sauce

    1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and begin drying your tofu. Drain, remove it from the package and place between two thick towels folded into the shape of the tofu. Then place a plate or bowl on top and top it with something heavy like a book or skillet.
    2. Let it dry for about 15 minutes, changing your towels if they get too wet. Once dry, chop into roughly 1-inch cubes or rectangles.
    3. Arrange tofu on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent sticking and bake for a total of 25-35 minutes, flipping once halfway through to ensure even cooking. This will dry out the tofu and help give it a more meat-like texture. If you want a tougher texture, cook it for 30-35. For a slightly more tender texture, pull it out at 20-25 minutes to check.
    4. Once it’s golden brown and a bit tough and firm, remove from the oven set it out to dry a bit more while you prep your vegetables. Ideally, it would set out another 45 minutes or even longer. I haven’t tried letting it set out for much longer, but I don’t think it would hurt either way.
    5. If serving over rice, start the rice at this point.
    6. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients – set aside.
    7. To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add sesame oil and swirl to coat. Then add veggies and toss to coat. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring often. When the vegetables have some color and have softened a bit, add the sauce and stir. It should bubble and thicken. Then add the tofu and stir to coat.
    8. Cook the mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. When veggies are cooked to your preferred doneness, remove from heat. Serve as is or over rice for a more filling meal. Best when eaten fresh, though will keep in the refrigerator for a couple days.

The sauce for this stir fry is delicious!  A great tip to help this to come together quickly is to bake the tofu ahead of time (or at least to drain it).  

Great with other veggies too:
  * baby corn
  * snap peas
  * sno peas
  * broccoli
  * scallions
  * baby bok choy
