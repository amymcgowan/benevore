	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Amy and this is my own personal log of recipies that I have found that I absolutely love making for myself and my family.  If you have happened to stumble across it ... welcome!</p>

	<p>What is "benevore"?  Well, you've probably heard of an herbivore - one who eats only plants.  And a carnivore eats meat.  And an omnivore eats all the things.  Well, a benevore eats the good things.  "Good" may be a contestable, but here it means whole foods and plants.  These are foods that are good for the human body, the earth, and the animals with whom we share this earth.</p>
	
	<p>A note about these recipes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Very few, if any, of them are my own.  They have been taken from some of my favorite food people online and I've notated it on each one.  I definitely encourage you to check them out!</li>
		<li>Everything here is, at it's root, plant-based, meaning no meat, dairy, or eggs.  However, although I do not eat these things, some in my family do, so I have made note of ways that I can make these meals work for our whole family.  So you might see some meat-based recipes tagged onto the end here and there.</li>
		<li>Each one is tried and tested and loved by my family!</li>
	</ul>
